# Microservices
This is a microservice-based system that provides movie info, ratings, and catalog functionality through a REST API.
It consists of several microservices that work together to provide movie information, ratings, and a movie catalog. The movie info microservice provides information about movies such as their title, synopsis, and release date. The movie rating microservice provides ratings and reviews for the movies. The movie catalog microservice provides a catalog of movies that can be filtered and searched based on different criteria. Users can interact with the system using a REST API to access the different services and retrieve the desired information. The system architecture is designed to be scalable and resilient to handle large amounts of data and traffic.
